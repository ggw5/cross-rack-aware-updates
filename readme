This source code is an implementation for the paper: 
Cross-Rack-Aware Updates in Erasure-Coded Storage Systems (Zhirong Shen, Patrick P.C. Lee)
in Proceedings of 47th International Conference on Parallel Processing. 

Before running the program, please take the following steps first: 

- change the default configurations in "config.h", including the erasure code you wish to use, and data center architecutre (e.g., the number of racks, and the number of nodes in each rack).
  Notice that we currently assume that all racks are composed of the same number of nodes. 

- run "gen_chunk_distribn" on the metadata server, which will generate the mapping information between the logical chunk id and the associated storage node. The metadata server will use it for chunk addressing.

- please generate a big file named "data_file" which will be used for simulating disk reads and writes. In our test, we generally set its size as 60GB. 

If you have any question, please feel free to contact me (zhirong.shen2601@gmail.com).
